            Considering that the purpose of the research is to identify patterns
            and themes regarding sustainable travel plans at Coventry
            University, a multi-method qualitative data methodology and
            subsequent analysis approaches were be employed to gather
            information and facts from surveys' secondary data, published
            articles, books, and reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data for this study was collected using structured literature
            review and secondary data from surveys. The environment team
            provided the data for this study as part of a staff and student
            travel survey conducted in November 2021. Due to the timeframe and
            project deadline, a subset of the survey data (692 responses)
            recorded between 02/11/2021 and 18/11/2021 was used. The survey
            consisted of a travel behaviour section and socioeconomic
            characteristics section. No personal information was disclosed to
            the researcher.

          SWOT analysis is a strategic planning approach that examines an
          organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
          (GÃ¼rel, 2017). To align existing travel plans with university
          sustainability goals, a SWOT analysis was performed.
