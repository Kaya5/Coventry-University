The university\n          is in the heart of Coventry, which has approximately 371,000 residents\n          (Coventry City Council, 2021). Coventry University gained university\n          status in 1992. It currently operates several campuses and services\n          worldwide, notably the Coventry University Group (Coventry University,\n          n.d.).\n        </p>\n        </div>\n\n<div>\n        <Header title=\"Business Issue\" />\n        <p>\n          Coventry University's sustainable travel plan encourages walking,\n          cycling, car sharing, and reducedÂ reliance on automobiles to aid in\n          the transition to sustainable modes of transportation. Automobiles, on\n          the other hand, continue to be the most popular method of\n          transportation, with automobile fleets expanding at the same rate as\n          the population. To gain a better understanding of how staff and\n          students commute to campus, the environment team conducts travel\n          surveys.\n          The findings are critical in determining the trip plan's objectives,\n          targets, and action plan. Over a five-year period, the travel plan\n          intends to reduce travel by private car for staff and students to the\n          site and boost journeys conducted by sustainable modes of\n          transportation (2015-2020).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As a result, this study attempts to uncover behavioural tendencies\n          toward sustainable travel plans at Coventry University and give\n          recommendations to strengthen the existing measures.\n        </p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n        <Header title=\"Research Objectives\" />\n        <p>\n        This study aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing sustainable travel plan at Coventry University, assess the barriers to uptake, and propose strategies to improve sustainable commute to the campus.

According to the survey, 93.5% of\n                respondents have not embraced the university's car-share\n                initiatives, citing lack of awareness as the main reason for\n                this. As seen in Figure 10, awareness a key impediment to\n                numerous initiatives. 27% of respondents were unaware of any\n                university sustainable travel initiative. Previous studies have\n                found that commuters' awareness of carbon emissions impacts\n                their decisions (Cao & Yang, 2017; Jia et al., 2018; Liu et al.,\n                2017).\n                <Picture image={picture7} />\n              </li>\n\n              <li>\n                <b>Covid-19 Pandemic:</b>\n                The CU car share is an eco-friendly effort created by the\n                institution to alleviate the distance issue. With the global\n                Covid-19 outbreak, carpooling became less acceptable to\n                commuters to preserve social distance and prevent virus\n                exposure. Most respondents said the pandemic influenced their\n                campus commute transportation choices. Majority of the\n                respondents are not confident to use CU car share or public\n                transportation due to the pandemic and have switched to either\n                cycling or lone driving to reduce the chances of contracting or\n                spreading the virus. The findings support prior research that\n                the Covid-19 pandemic impacts user mobility choices,\n                particularly ecologically friendly modes (Beck & Hensher, 2020;\n                De Haas et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020).\n                <Picture image={picture8} />\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          \n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </article>\n      <div className=\"buttons\">\n        <div className=\"home-button\">\n          <Button\n            href=\"/page-two\"\n            // size=\"large\"\n            // variant=\"outlined\"\n            // color='secondary'\n            style={prev}\n          >\n            previous\n          </Button>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"next-btn\">\n          <Button href=\"/page-four\" style={next}>\n            next\n          </Button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default PageThree;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Picture9.fcf4162e.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\nimport Button from \"@material-ui/core/Button\";\nimport Scroll from \"../components/Scroll\";\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer\";\nimport { prev, next } from \"../components/styles\";\nimport Picture from \"../components/Picture\";\n\nimport picture9 from \"../assets/Picture9.jpg\";\n\nimport \"../styles/Pages.css\";\n\n\nfunction PageFour() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page\">\n      <article className=\"article\">\n        <Scroll />\n        <div>\n          <Header title=\"Comparison Between Present and Previous Survey\" />\n          <p>\n            This year's Coventry University survey shows that student adoption\n            of sustainable transport has increased from 70% in 2018 to around 86\n            % in 2021. As indicated, students choose to walk, cycle, or take the\n            train to campus, which is good for the school's sustainable mobility\n            plan. The substantial disparity in student and staff adoption of\n            eco-friendly transport systems may be connected to disparities in\n            distance from the university and individual preferences.\n            <Picture image={picture9} />\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Using this study as a benchmark of progress, some of Coventry\n            University's goals have been achieved but others remain unachieved.\n            For instance, the university has a target to achieve single staff\n            occupancy of car to 35% in 2020 and in 2021 single staff car usage\n            stands at 45%, making 10% below target. Similarly, the university\n            set targets for staff cycling, walking, bus use, and car sharing at\n            14%, 16%, 15%, and 7%. The study found none of these targets have\n            been met, as staff cycling is 44% below target (currently at 7.8%),\n            walking is 20% below target (currently at 12.8%), and bus usage is\n            almost 60% below target (currently at 6.8% compared to 15% target).\n            This study found that only 12% of the target train usage was\n            achieved given that the current study indicated 15.8% train usage\n            among staff. It is also comparable from a student standpoint, as the\n            university has only been able to meet its goal of students walking\n            to/from the university (target is 57%) since 69% of students have\n            adopted walking to/from the university. Furthermore, the study found\n            that the university is almost 70% off its target in terms of student\n            cycle uptake and 44% off its target in terms of student train\n            utilisation.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <Header title=\"Recommendations\" />\n          <p>\n            {\" \"}\n            The administration of Coventry University clearly must improve in a\n            few areas.
